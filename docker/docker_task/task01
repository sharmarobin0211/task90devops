Containerization is generally preferred over virtualization for microservices and CI/CD pipelines 
due to its lighter resource consumption, faster startup times, and greater portability. While virtualization 
creates a full OS instance for each virtual machine, containerization packages applications and their dependencies 
into lightweight containers that share the host OS kernel, making them ideal for rapidly deploying and 
scaling microservices and facilitating automated CI/CD pipelines. 

EXAMPLE:
       Consider an e-commerce application with microservices for product catalog,shopping cart, payment processing, 
and user authentication. Each microservice can be packaged into a separate container.During the CI/CD pipeline,
a new version of the product catalog service can be built, tested, and deployed by simply replacing the existing 
container with the updated one. This rapid deployment process is facilitated by the portability and resouces
efficiency of containerization, making it ideal for agile development practices.
