In real-world networking, ping and ipconfig/ifconfig are the most frequently used commands. 
These commands are used for basic network connectivity checks and display network configuration details, respectively. 
While other commands like traceroute, netstat, nslookup/dig, route, and telnet are also crucial, 

they are often used in more specific troubleshooting or network analysis scenarios. 
Here's a breakdown of why these commands are so popular: 
ping:
This command is used to test if a network device is reachable. It sends an ICMP echo request packet to a destination and waits for a reply.
This is the first step in many troubleshooting scenarios.

ipconfig/ifconfig:
These commands display the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and other TCP/IP configuration information of the network interface. 
They are essential for understanding how a device is configured on the network.
While other commands are important for specific tasks, ping and ipconfig/ifconfig are the foundational tools used most often in everyday 
network troubleshooting and management.
